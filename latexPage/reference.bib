  abstract       = {The problem of optimizing the topography of metal structures allowing Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) sensing is considered. We developed a model, which randomly distributes hemispheroidal particles over a given area of the glass substrate and estimates SERS capabilities of the obtained structures. We applied Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis to modeled structures and to atomic force microscope images widely used in SERS metal island films and metal dendrites. The comparison of measured and calculated SERS signals from differing characteristics structures with the results of PSD analysis of these structures has shown that this approach allows simple identification and choosing a structure topography, which is capable of providing the maximal enhancement of Raman signal within a given set of structures of the same type placed on the substrate.},

abstract = {The aim of this article is to develop a GPS/IMU multisensor fusion algorithm, taking context into consideration. Contextual variables are introduced to define fuzzy validity domains of each sensor. The algorithm increases the reliability of the position information. A simulation of this algorithm is then made by fusing GPS and IMU data coming from real tests on a land vehicle. Bad data delivered by GPS sensor are detected and rejected using contextual information thus increasing reliability. Moreover, because of a lack of credibility of GPS signal in some cases and because of the drift of the INS, GPS/INS association is not satisfactory at the moment. In order to avoid this problem, the authors propose to feed the fusion process based on a multisensor Kalman filter directly with the acceleration provided by the IMU. Moreover, the filter developed here gives the possibility to easily add other sensors in order to achieve performances required.}
